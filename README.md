1. Write a function to add two numbers and write a test case for it.
2. Write a function to subtract two numbers and write a test case for it.
3. Write a function to multiply two numbers and write a test case for it.
4. Write a function to divide two numbers and write a test case for it.
5. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of all elements. Write test cases for it.
6. Write a function to find the maximum number in an array. Write test cases for it.
7. Write a function to find the minimum number in an array. Write test cases for it.
8. Write a function that takes a string and returns the reversed string. Write test cases for it.
9. Write a function that takes a string and returns the length of the string. Write test cases for it.
10. Write a function that takes an array of strings and returns a new array with all elements capitalized. Write test cases for it.
Function and Arrow Functions:
11. Write a function that takes two numbers and returns the sum. Use arrow function syntax.
12. Write a function that takes two numbers and returns the product. Use arrow function syntax.
13. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array with each element squared. Use arrow function syntax.
14. Write a function that takes a string and returns the length of the string.
Classes (OOP):
15. Create a class called `Rectangle` with properties `width` and `height`, and methods `area()` and `perimeter()`. Write test cases for it.
16. Create a class called `Circle` with properties `radius` and methods `area()` and `circumference()`. Write test cases for it.
Object and Array:
17. Create an object representing a person with properties: `name`, `age`, and `gender`.
18. Create an array of objects representing multiple persons.
19. Write a function that takes an array of objects (each representing a person) and returns the total age of all persons.
20. Write a function that takes an array of objects (each representing a person) and returns an array of names.
Additional (you can choose to write a test or not):
26. Write a function that takes a number as input and returns true if the number is even, false otherwise.
27. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the average of all elements.
28. Write a function that takes a string and returns the number of vowels in it.
29. Write a function that takes two arrays and returns a new array containing elements common to both arrays.
30. Write a function that takes an array of strings and returns the longest string.
Additional (Difficult):
31. Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the count of each character in the string as an object. Use arrow function syntax.
32. Write a function that takes an array of objects and a key and returns a new array with the values of that key from each object. Use arrow function syntax.
33. Write a function that takes a nested array of numbers and returns a new array with the sum of each sub-array. Use arrow function syntax.
